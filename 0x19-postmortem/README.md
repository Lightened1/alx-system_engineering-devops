Postmortem: Service Outage on Acme Web Application

Issue Summary:
Duration: September 15, 2023, 08:00 AM - September 15, 2023, 11:30 AM (PST)
Impact: The Acme web application experienced a complete service outage. Users were unable to access the application, resulting in a 100% user impact during the outage.

Timeline:

08:00 AM: Issue detected by monitoring system alerting a sudden drop in incoming requests.
08:05 AM: Engineers investigated the system logs and identified a potential database connectivity issue.
08:15 AM: Investigation focused on the database cluster to identify the root cause.
09:30 AM: Misleading assumption made that the issue was due to a network misconfiguration.
10:00 AM: Incident escalated to the database administration team for further investigation.
10:30 AM: The database administration team identified a misconfiguration in the database replication setup.
11:00 AM: The misconfiguration was fixed, and the database cluster was brought back online.
11:30 AM: The Acme web application was fully restored, and users regained access.
Root Cause and Resolution:
The root cause of the service outage was a misconfiguration in the database replication setup. During routine maintenance, a misstep in the replication configuration caused the database cluster to become unresponsive, leading to the application downtime.

To resolve the issue, the database administration team reconfigured the replication setup and ensured that the database cluster was properly synchronized. This fix reestablished the connection between the web application and the database, restoring the service functionality.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:
To prevent similar incidents in the future, the following measures will be implemented:

Improved Monitoring: Enhance the monitoring system to provide more granular visibility into the database replication status and detect misconfigurations promptly.

Automated Health Checks: Implement automated health checks for critical components, including database clusters, to identify and alert on misconfigurations or abnormalities.

Configuration Audits: Conduct regular audits of system configurations to ensure consistency and prevent misconfigurations from going unnoticed.

Disaster Recovery Testing: Establish a regular testing schedule for disaster recovery scenarios to verify the effectiveness of backup and replication processes.

Tasks to Address the Issue:

Conduct a thorough review of the database replication setup and document the correct configuration.

Update the disaster recovery plan to include database replication checks and procedures for addressing misconfigurations.

Enhance the monitoring system to include specific checks for database replication health and failure scenarios.

Schedule a post-incident review meeting to discuss the incident, lessons learned, and any additional preventive measures.

Communicate the incident and its resolution to the affected users, providing transparency and assuring them of steps taken to prevent future occurrences.

This postmortem highlights the root cause of the service outage, the actions taken to resolve it, and the measures to prevent similar incidents in the future. By implementing these corrective and preventative measures, Acme aims to enhance the reliability and stability of its web application, ensuring a seamless user experience.
